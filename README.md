***XSS Payload Selector***
-----------------------------
This program generates a list of cross-site scripting (XSS) payloads based on the user's input, allowing them to filter out certain strings and keep others. The program then randomly selects a specified number of payloads from the filtered list to display to the user.

Using this program can have several advantages:

i) Saves time: Rather than manually generating XSS payloads, this program automates the process and generates multiple payloads quickly.

ii) Customizable: Users can specify strings to filter out or keep, allowing for customization of the payloads generated.

iii) Increases security: By generating and testing a variety of XSS payloads, users can identify potential vulnerabilities in their applications and take steps to prevent them before an attacker can exploit them.

Overall, this program can be a valuable tool for web developers and security professionals looking to test the security of their applications and identify potential XSS vulnerabilities.

The above program is an XSS payload generator written in Python. It reads a list of XSS payloads from a text file, filters the payloads based on user input, and then randomly selects a specified number of payloads to display.

The program provides the user with the option to filter out payloads that contain certain strings or to keep only payloads that contain certain strings. This allows the user to generate payloads that are tailored to their specific needs. Additionally, the program ensures that the specified number of payloads to display is within the range of available payloads after filtering.

One advantage of using this program is that it simplifies the process of generating XSS payloads. Instead of manually creating payloads or searching for existing payloads online, the user can quickly and easily generate a list of payloads that are tailored to their needs. This can save time and effort, particularly for users who need to generate large numbers of payloads or who have specific requirements for their payloads.

Another advantage of using this program is that it ensures that the generated payloads are filtered based on user input. This can help to ensure that the payloads are safe and do not contain any strings that could cause harm. By filtering out certain strings or keeping only certain strings, the user can ensure that the generated payloads are specific to their needs and do not contain any unnecessary or potentially harmful content.

Overall, the XSS payload generator program is a useful tool for anyone who needs to generate XSS payloads quickly and easily. It provides flexibility and customization options while also ensuring that the generated payloads are safe and tailored to the user's needs.
