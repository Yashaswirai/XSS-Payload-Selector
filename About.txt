The code reads in a list of payloads from a file called "payloads.txt" and allows the user to specify strings to filter out of the payloads and/or strings that should be present in the payloads. If the user chooses to filter out payloads, the script will remove any payloads that contain any of the specified strings to filter out. If the user chooses to specify strings that should be present in the payloads, the script will keep only the payloads that contain any of the specified strings. The script then prompts the user to specify how many payloads to display and chooses that many payloads at random from the list of payloads (after filtering and keeping, if specified). Finally, it displays the payloads.
